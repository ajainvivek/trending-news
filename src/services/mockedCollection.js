Airbnb apartment.</p><p>The three women, from Derby, UK, had flown to Madrid after booking a room in an eight-storey apartment block through the popular online rental site.</p><p>But in a nightmare twist, the ceiling of a neighbouring room caved in, filling the apartment with rubble and what appeared to be asbestos, leaving their belongings covered in dust.</p><p>\"I rushed out of the kitchen only to be greeted with a cloud of grey dust coming towards me - within seconds it had covered the whole apartment,\" 20-year-old Jess Robinson told The Mirror.</p><p>\"I started choking and grabbed a

Zimbabwe and Zambia through 2018.</p><p>It said the two countries had developed robust conservation programs that would enhance the survival of African elephants, the world's largest land

effort\" to address its economic woes and other states shouldn't have it bail it out with a GST shake-up.</p><p>At a Productivity Commission public hearing in Melbourne on Friday, Tim Pallas said Victoria stands to lose $972 million in the 2017-18 financial year alone, thanks to GST revenue driven from the eastern states to the west.</p><p>He said it would mean cuts equivalent to 9300 teachers, 8700 nurses, 7700 police officers or purchasing more than 100 E-Class trams.</p><p>The commission's draft report on the GST carve-up has recommended tweaks to take into account the states' and territories' changing economic fortunes.</p><p>The report found the current version of the horizontal fiscal equalisation system discouraged governments from reforming their tax systems and pursuing productivity.</p><p>Mr Pallas said Victoria strongly supports the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation and the new proposal is \"certainly worse than the existing arrangement\".</p><p>\"We are not interested in such a distortion and such a gifted bounty to the state of Western Australia, a state that has made little effort to address its underlying economic and budget problems,\" he said.</p><p>\"There has been no imperative for them to make change and that is a decision that those governments have had to live with.\"</p><p>He said Victoria was already getting a raw deal on infrastructure funding from the Commonwealth and couldn't take a further hit.</p><p>WA's share of the GST revenue has plunged in recent years, due to the complicated horizontal equalisation formula that is supposed to allocate funds based on need and how a state is performing economically.</p><p>This year WA received only 34 cents for every dollar raised despite its slow economy, while NSW got back 88 cents, Victoria 93 and the rest were all well above 100 cents.</p><p>The commission is due to hold hearings in Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin before it delivers its report over the next 12 months.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/vic/a/37905656/vic-could-lose-1b-a-year-if-gst-changes/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37905656/vic-could-lose-1b-a-year-if-gst-changes/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37905656/vic-could-lose-1b-a-year-if-gst-changes/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/vic/a/37905656/vic-could-lose-1b-a-year-if-gst-changes/"},"by_line":"Christopher

RugbyWA forced into voluntary administration because it can't pay Rugby Australia's legal costs.</p><p>RugbyWA claims it simply hasn't the cash to settle the bill.</p><p>It also owes $1.14 million to the WA government for the 2009 upgrade of nib Stadium as well as an unspecified amount to law firm Lavan.</p><p>But it's RA (formerly the ARU)'s pursuit of legal costs stemming from the arbitration and Supreme Court fights with the Western Force that have brought RugbyWA to its knees after the national body won both battles.</p><p>It's believed RA's total legal fees associated with axing the Super Rugby franchise are about $1.7 million of which RA is said to want RugbyWA to pay about $900,00.</p><p>RugbyWA, funded largely by billionaire miner Andrew Forrest, offered RA about $500,000 to settle.</p><p>However that's been rejected and with subsequent negotiations breaking down, RugbyWA has taken the drastic step of calling in advisory and investment firm KordaMentha Restructuring.</p><p>Despite the dramatic turn of events, it's highly unlikely RugbyWA will fold.</p><p>KordaMentha administrator Scott Langdon hopes to raise enough capital to hand back control to the RugbyWA board before Christmas and will meet creditors, including RA, within the next fortnight.</p><p>After that, the firm will have about a month to raise enough money and renegotiate a settlement figure for the costs.</p><p>In the unlikely event RugbyWA still can't meet its debts, it will become extinct.</p><p>\"If those proposals are not acceptable to creditors, then there is a potential chance that we could wind up rugby in Western Australia,\" Langdon said.</p><p>\"But the sole purpose of the voluntary administration process is to rehabilitate and reconstruct the balance sheet so we provide a platform for the future.\"</p><p>RugbyWA chairman Tony Howarth says RA knew all along RugbyWA wasn't in a position to pay the legal costs.</p><p>\"I think they're very aware of what they're doing,\" he said.</p><p>\"In our mind they've been quite purposeful in what they're doing. They were certainly very purposeful in removing the Western Force.</p><p>\"Some feel it's been an abandonment of rugby in WA.\"</p><p>RugbyWA's woes come at an awkward time for Forrest, who is trying to negotiate with RA about approving his new competition - the Indo Pacific Rugby Championship.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/rugby/a/37905390/rugbywa-goes-into-voluntary-administration/","au.ausport":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/rugby/a/37905390/rugbywa-goes-into-voluntary-administration/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37905390/rugbywa-goes-into-voluntary-administration/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/sport/37905390/rugbywa-goes-into-voluntary-administration/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/sport/37905390/rugbywa-goes-into-voluntary-administration/"},"by_line":"Justin

Listed Merson Cooper Stakes at Sandown and is leaning towards the filly Oohood as the pick of his runners.</p><p>McEvoy won last Saturday's Group Three Maribyrnong Plate (1000m) at Flemington with unbeaten colt Run Naan and the trainer saddles up Oohood and colt Secret Blaze in Saturday's Listed 1000m race.</p><p>Oohood has firmed from $5 to $3.20 favouritism with TAB fixed odds since the market opened on Wednesday while Secret Blaze is at $8.50.</p><p>McEvoy has won the Merson Cooper Stakes twice in recent years with Maximus Moonard (2011) and Jackson (2015).</p><p>\"I'm very happy to have them there,\" McEvoy said.</p><p>\"Oohood trialled really nicely in Adelaide. She's only had one trial so she'll be a little bit down on experience, and I normally prefer to give them two trials, but she's a very quick learner.</p><p>\"I've decided to trust her and run her on the back of one trial and she had a gallop at Sandown this week and galloped well.\"</p><p>Secret Blaze has had two barrier trials in Adelaide, the most recent a winning one over 1000m at Gawler last Friday.</p><p>\"It's been a bit of a big week for him,\" McEvoy said.</p><p>\"He trialled in Adelaide last Friday, he's travelled across to Melbourne and he's running this Saturday.</p><p>\"The reason I accepted with him was that he's eaten up and seems to have handled it, and his two trials have been really good.</p><p>\"I'd expect my two to run nice, competitive races.</p><p>\"I'd probably lean to the filly (Oohood) on pure ability. But (Secret Blaze) has probably had a bit better preparation into it.\"</p><p>Six of the eight juveniles in the race are at single figure

The first group received instruction on memory strategies; the second group received instruction on reasoning strategies; and the third group received individual computerised speed of processing training.</p><p>Participants in the cognitive training groups were offered 10 initial sessions of 60-75 minutes of training which was conducted for six weeks.</p><p>All participants were assessed on a number of cognitive and functional measures at the beginning of the study, after the first six weeks, and every year for five years and then again at 10 years.</p><p>Each intervention group also received four additional \"booster\" training sessions in months 11 and 35 of the study.</p><p>Researchers found no significant difference in risk of dementia for the strategy-based memory or reasoning training groups, as compared to the control group.</p><p>However, as compared to the control group, the computerised speed training group showed significantly less risk of dementia and those who completed more sessions had lower risk.</p><p>Among those who completed 15 or more sessions across all three intervention groups, the risk of dementia for the computerised speed training group was lowest at 5.9 per cent, as compared to 9.7 per cent and 10.1 per cent for the memory and reasoning groups, respectively.</p><p>The control group, which did not engage in any training, had a dementia incidence rate of 10.8 per cent</p><p>Dr Edwards says more research is now needed to investigate what makes some computerised cognitive training effective, while other types are not.</p><p>The results of the randomised control trial is published in journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/37906504/computer-brain-training-cuts-dementia-risk/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/37906504/computer-brain-training-cuts-dementia-risk/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37906504/computer-brain-training-cuts-dementia-risk/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37906504/computer-brain-training-cuts-dementia-risk/"},"by_line":"Sarah Wiedersehn","profile_id":null,"seo_headline":"Computer brain training cuts dementia risk","state_code":0,"thumbnails":{},"story_url":null,"headline":"Computer brain training cuts dementia risk","type_code":"3"},{"thread_id":"37903226","classifications":"2:112:,3:224:232:233:,4:245:247:,4:13772:13773:,4:245:22682:,1:331:,1:331:332:","links":[],"expires":"2017-12-17 15:34:19","type_name":"article","status_code":0,"published":"2017-11-17 15:35:02","source":"AAP","abstract":"<p>The world's best preserved mammoth, a 42,000-year-old baby mammoth named Lyuba, is going on display for the first time Down Under at the Australian Museum.</p>","title":"Baby mammoth makes a move Down Under","body":"<p>She may be 42,000 years old, but age hasn't been a barrier for Lyuba the baby woolly mammoth making her first trip to Australia.</p><p>Regarded as the most complete and best-preserved mammoth ever unearthed anywhere in the world, Lyuba has arrived in Sydney as the star of a new Ice Age exhibition at the Australian Museum.</p><p>Ever since Lyuba was found in 2007, by a reindeer hunter and his three sons in Siberia, the baby mammoth has been a source of intrigue for paleontologists.</p><p>\"She's a truly remarkable specimen,\" the Australian Museum's paleontologist Dr Matthew McCurry told AAP.</p><p>\"I've never seen something extinct that is that well preserved.</p><p>\"Lyuba is almost complete. She's only missing her tail and ear and some sections of her fur, so she's exceptionally preserved.\"</p><p>Scientists believe Lyuba was only 30 to 35 days old when she died, possibly after choking on mud after becoming stuck in a river.</p><p>\"She was found by a reindeer herder and hunter in Siberia and his sons and when they found Lyuba they reported it to the local museum but when the museum went back to pick up the specimen it wasn't there any more ,\" Dr McCurry said.</p><p>\"Someone had taken it to the local store and propped it up outside.

of Africa.</p><p>Most died out about 10,000 years ago, with the last of the dwarf mammoths becoming extinct 4000 years ago.</p><p>Scientists remain puzzled about what precisely caused their extinction, with some theories based on environmental factors such as global warming and hunting by humans.</p><p>US scientists earlier this year also speculated that the giant herbivores may have disappeared because genetic mutations caused them to lose their sense of smell and transformed their famous lengthy woolly fur into a more silky and shiny covering.</p><p>Their closest living relatives are elephants, particularly the Asian elephant.</p><p>Lyuba is usually on display at the Shemanovskiy Museum in Yamal, near where she was found in northwest Siberia, and has been loaned to

grow up 3m tall and weigh five tonnes</p><p>* Their hairy coats were up to 1m long, with a a fine wool underlayer</p><p>* Mammoths spent 18 hours a day eating, mostly grass</p><p>* The last dwarf

the European Union has raised a threat to vital trade preferences after the main opposition party was banned ahead of elections.</p><p>The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court on Thursday at the request of the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose rule of more than three decades faces a major challenge at next year's general election.</p><p>The ban on the CNRP followed the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha, for treason. He is accused of plotting to take power with American help.</p><p>Hun Sen's critics called the CNRP dissolution an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy after Western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multi-party system following decades of war.</p><p>\"On current course next year's election will not be legitimate, free, or fair,\" a White House statement said, promising to take \"concrete steps\".</p><p>The first of those was to end support for the Cambodian National Election Committee ahead of the 2018 election, it said.</p><p>In Brussels, an EU spokesman said the election could not be legitimate without the opposition and noted that respect for human rights was a prerequisite for Cambodia's access to EU trade preferences under its \"Everything But Arms scheme\".</p><p>That scheme giving tariff free access - and similar trade preferences in the US - have helped Cambodia build a garment industry on low cost labour. Between them, EU and US markets take some 60 per cent of Cambodia's exports.</p><p>There was no immediate government response to the reaction from the US and

torture of his girlfriend's mother and to have her teeth extracted \"one by one\", has been jailed in Melbourne.</p><p>The 34-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, raped his partner twice and assaulted her on numerous occasions during their six-month relationship, with the woman fleeing from him in fear of her life.</p><p>A County Court sentencing judge on Friday said the man had denied the charges, instead attacking the victim's credibility and claiming she'd manufactured the claims for financial gain.</p><p>\"You were violent, possessive and controlling and behaved unpredictably towards the complainant,\" the judge said.</p><p>\"She fled from you in fear you might ultimately kill her.\"</p><p>The judge described the offending as a \"very ugly example\" of a man abusing and controlling a vulnerable female partner.</p><p>\"Your offending involves a breach of trust that your victim should expect from you, her intimate partner,\" he said.</p><p>The woman, her mother and sister told a jury trial in October the man had become possessive, volatile and controlling.</p><p>In June 2015, the woman attended a friend's 30th birthday party, which upset the man, who sent her more than 50 \"abusive text messages\" that evening.</p><p>On her return, he assaulted the woman before raping her on the bed, the court was told.</p><p>On another occasion during the same month, the man pushed, shoved and punched the woman after he produced photos of her and a previous partner.</p><p>The man also threatened to have the victim's mother tortured if she looked at him \"in that way again\".</p><p>The court was told on other occasions, the man pulled the woman's hair, causing amounts of it to break off into his hands.</p><p>He also threatened to make her \"mentally incapacitated\" and that he'd injure her so she'd need to use a wheelchair.</p><p>The man was sentenced to nine years and two months in jail and must serve at least six-and-a-half years before being eligible for parole.</p><p>Since the legal case started, the man has resigned from his banking career and is said to be \"largely isolated\" after losing friends and

public service, undermining Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls promise not to cut jobs.</p><p>The Liberal Party elder statesman campaigned alongside LNP MP Tarnya Smith in her marginal Brisbane electorate of Mount Ommaney on Friday as he joined the state campaign for the first time.</p><p>Asked about Queensland's rising debt problem, Mr Howard said economic growth and activity would help eliminate money that was owed but also said a slimmer public service would reduce the burden.</p><p>\"You also eliminate debt by not just appointing unnecessarily large numbers of state employees,\" he said.</p><p>\"You need a certain number of state employees but I think it's fair to say that the number appointed by the present government has got a little bit out of proportion.\"</p><p>Mr Nicholls has been haunted during the election campaign over the role he played in the sacking of 14,000 public servants during Campbell Newman's government.</p><p>The opposition leader has repeatedly apologised and ruled out axing government workers if he is elected to govern.</p><p>Mr Howard also lashed Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk over her mixed messages about the Adani coal mine.</p><p>\"The first requirement of effective leadership in politics, whether you're Labor or Liberal or National Party or LNP or whatever, is to know what you believe in and where you stand,\" he said.</p><p>\"The problem Annastacia Palaszczuk has is that I don't know where she stands on the Adani mine.\"</p><p>Mr Howard said the premier's views had changed based on where she was in Queensland.</p><p>\"In one part of the state she's for it, in another part of the state she's sort of against it and in another part of the state (she's) right against it,\" he said.</p><p>\"Now that is unimpressive irrespective of what your politics are.\"</p><p>The premier has come under fire during the election campaign over her handling of the Adani issue after she vowed to veto a $1 billion federal taxpayer-funded loan to the mining giant.</p><p>She initially said the decision was to avoid the perception of a conflict of interest following revelations her partner Shaun Drabsch worked on the loan application with employer PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>But Ms Palaszczuk later said it was to meet a 2015 election commitment.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/a/37906449/howard-slams-palaszczuk-over-adani-mine/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37906449/howard-slams-palaszczuk-over-adani-mine/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37906449/howard-slams-palaszczuk-over-adani-mine/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/a/37906449/howard-slams-palaszczuk-over-adani-mine/"},"by_line":"Shae

to wait to learn what punishment a Queensland judge will hand down.</p>","title":"Tyrell Cobb case not a 'whodunnit': judge","body":"<p>The mother of Tyrell Cobb will have to wait to learn what punishment a Queensland judge will hand down after she pleaded guilty to manslaughter over the four-year-old's death.</p><p>Heidi Strbak pleaded guilty to the charge on the basis of criminal negligence after her young son died on May 24, 2009.</p><p>But the 34-year-old faced a contested sentencing in the Brisbane Supreme Court because prosecutors claim she inflicted a fatal blow or blows to the little boy, who vomited green bile before he died.</p><p>In his submissions on Friday, defence barrister Greg McGuire said it couldn't be established to the necessary legal standard his client had been responsible for those injuries.</p><p>He said it was a \"tragic reality\" the exact circumstances of Tyrell's death would never be known, while also claiming the circumstantial case against Strbak's then-partner Matthew Scown was stronger than that against the boy's mother.</p><p>But Justice Peter Applegarth told the court the case was not a \"whodunnit\" he would be required to solve.</p><p>\"This case is whether the prosecution can prove enough, on the balance of probabilities ... that your client was responsible for one of the fatal injuries,\" the judge told Mr McGuire.</p><p>Emotions ran high during the hearing, with Tyrell's biological father, Jason Cobb, slamming and damaging a glass door as he left the courtroom after giving his testimony.</p><p>The court was also shown confronting post-mortem images of the child's mottled body on the first day, as well as an audio recording of a frantic triple-zero call in which Scown tells the operator the child isn't breathing.</p><p>Crown prosecutor Phil McCarthy said on Thursday Strbak had demonstrated a \"capacity for deception\" when telling the truth did not advance her own self-interest.</p><p>He said she told \"clear lies\" to conceal from police she had left her Gold Coast home to obtain cannabis on the night Tyrell died.</p><p>In contrast, Mr McCarthy said Scown - who served as a key witness in the prosecution's case - had been \"frank and unguarded\" when giving evidence about the child's injuries.</p><p>Scown was last month sentenced to four years' jail for manslaughter but made headlines after he walked from court given he'd already spent two years and eight months in custody.</p><p>Justice Applegarth is expected to make a decision on the contested facts before the matter returns to court in mid-December.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/a/37906272/cobb-case-not-a-whodunnit-judge/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37906272/cobb-case-not-a-whodunnit-judge/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37906272/cobb-case-not-a-whodunnit-judge/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/a/37906272/cobb-case-not-a-whodunnit-judge/"},"by_line":"Alexandra

needs to be consistent if he is to become the next Mariners player to graduate to the Socceroos and become a World Cup bolter.</p><p>The Mariners No.10 has been earmarked for stardom since he played his first A-League game for Perth at just 15 years old in 2013.</p><p>De Silva, 20, returned to Australia mid-year following a stint at Dutch club Roda JC.</p><p>His impressive early-season form has prompted some pundits to nominate him as a potential World Cup selection surprise.</p><p>Okon has frequently sung De Silva's praises this season, but also urges caution given his youth.</p><p>\"I've had a few chats with Daniel, and he knows that if he can be consistent and first and foremost, perform for the Mariners, I think he gives himself an opportunity,\" Okon said following the Mariners 2-1 home loss to Adelaide United on Thursday</p><p>\"There's some good (Socceroo) players in Daniel's position, Tom Rogic, James Troisi.</p><p>\"He's still only 20 and he's still improving.</p><p>\"He's got to find that consistency and hopefully we can give him the game time to prove to, if it's (Socceroos coach) Ange (Postecoglou) or whoever else maybe, that he has the ability.</p><p>\"We'd love to see get him there, but there's a lot of work to be done in the meantime.\"</p><p>Okon said everyone at the club was proud of the cluster of former Mariners who are already vital and established members of the Socceroos squad.</p><p>Captain and midfield dynamo Mile Jedinak, playmaker Rogic, goalkeeper Mat Ryan and central defender Trent Sainsbury, all got their A-League break at the Gosford club.</p><p>\"It's something that the club wants to continue,\" Okon said.</p><p>\"They've been blessed to have some really good players come through here and move on to bigger and better things.\"</p><p>Thursday's night's loss, brought about by a 93rd-minute goal to Adelaide's Ryan Kitto, ended the Mariners' three-match unbeaten run.</p><p>\"We've been doing some good things of late, so we'll take it on the chin and move forward,\" Okon said.</p><p>Captain Alan Baro will be back from suspension for their next game away to Wellington on November 25 but Okon isn't sure whether striker Asdrubal and fullbacks Storm Roux and Josh Rose will join him.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/football/a/37899048/is-de-silva-a-world-cup-bolter/","au.ausport":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/football/a/37899048/is-de-silva-a-world-cup-bolter/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/soccer/37899048/is-de-silva-a-world-cup-bolter/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/soccer/37899048/is-de-silva-a-world-cup-bolter/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37899048/is-de-silva-a-world-cup-bolter/"},"by_line":"Adrian

Michael Gunner on Friday apologised for the way children were treated and the stain on the Territory's reputation.</p><p>Lawyers leading a class action for young people allegedly abused in NT youth detention centres welcomed the inquiry's call to close the Don Dale facility and place strict limits on when isolation can be used.</p><p>\"The royal commission's findings are consistent with our case

eighth Test recall.</p>","title":"Marsh should give hope to over-30s: Hohns","body":"<p>Trevor Hohns says Shaun Marsh's Ashes ascent disproves \"nonsense\" allegations about Australia's selection policy, but the chairman could hardly have picked a more polarising poster boy for the over-30s.</p><p>Marsh has been recalled to the Test XI for the eighth time in his stop-start career, with the veteran to face England in the series opener that starts in Brisbane on Thursday.</p><p>It comes five months after the subcontinent specialist was overlooked for a tour of Bangladesh.</p><p>Selecting the much-maligned batsman, who made his first-class debut in 2001 and excelled at under-age level alongside Shane Watson, Michael Clarke and Mitchell Johnson, has yet again generated immense disbelief, outrage and vitriol - the sort that Watson endured throughout his career.</p><p>Former paceman Brett Geeves termed the selection confusing and contradictory, opining \"it seems like something that just is not legal in the ways of the modern world\".</p><p>Hohns suggested Marsh, who recently topped the run-scoring charts in the domestic one-day competition and scored 91 against the Test attack during a recent Sheffield Shield game in Sydney, warranted selection and highlighted the poor performance of his rivals.</p><p>Hohns added the 34-year-old should give batsmen on the wrong side of 30 - some of whom have publicly questioned selectors' recent drive to blood youngsters at international level - hope.</p><p>\"I would think so. I would think it's the type of selection that is warranted number one,\" Hohns said.</p><p>\"And secondly also displays we're just no here to pick a development side as has been touted a little bit in the past. That's just nonsense.\"</p><p>Last year's overhaul of the XI, after a horrible loss in Hobart, led to Matthew Renshaw, Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson making their debuts.</p><p>Hohns' panel made six changes to the incumbent XI this time but, Cameron Bancroft aside, took a view it was better the devil you know.</p><p>He backed Marsh, who has scored four Test tons and helped salvage a draw in Ranchi earlier this year, to deliver ahead of less experienced contenders.</p><p>\"The younger players we have chosen over the past 12 months or so, at this stage haven't given us enough performance to be chosen in the initial squad for the Ashes,\" Hohns said.</p><p>\"The Ashes is very important, we don't feel it's the ideal venue to inject them again.\"</p><p>Steve Smith, who has watched Marsh score Test centuries from the non-striker's end in South Africa and Sri Lanka, backed the contentious call.</p><p>\"He played very well (in the Shield game against Smith's NSW) and he's been opening the batting,\" Smith said.</p><p>\"No.6 is a spot where you could potentially face the second new ball and he's been doing that.</p><p>\"He's hitting the ball really well. Justin Langer's been saying for some time he (Marsh) has been in the form of his life.\"</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/cricket/a/37907851/marsh-should-give-hope-to-over-30s-hohns/","au.ausport":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/cricket/a/37907851/marsh-should-give-hope-to-over-30s-hohns/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/cricket/37907851/marsh-should-give-hope-to-over-30s-hohns/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/cricket/37907851/marsh-should-give-hope-to-over-30s-hohns/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907851/marsh-should-give-hope-to-over-30s-hohns/"},"by_line":"Rob

Lambie is himself likely to be referred to the High Court.</p>","title":"High Court likely to test councillor cloud","body":"<p>The eligibility of local government councillors to run for federal parliament will almost certainly be tested in the High Court, as the citizenship crisis takes a new turn.</p><p>Steve Martin, the mayor of Devonport in Tasmania, is expected to replace Jacqui Lambie after the Tasmanian senator quit parliament over her dual citizenship.</p><p>However, legal experts have questioned whether his local government status could be regarded as an \"office of profit under the Crown\", which would constitutionally disqualify him from parliament.</p><p>Mr Martin told reporters on Friday he had advice he could take up the seat, but he was open to having his eligibility tested in the court.</p><p>The first opportunity for this is expected to be Ms Lambie's High Court directions hearing on December 8, in which her lawyers will appear alongside those for Stephen Parry, who also lost his Senate seat in the citizenship crisis.</p><p>\"I certainly would welcome that opportunity, should they referred me to that High Court, for the clearing up of the murky waters,\" Mr Martin said.</p><p>Ms Lambie has advice from former Senate clerk Rosemary Laing, dated March 17 last year, in which she says it is \"unlikely\" a mayoral office would be found to be an office of profit under the Crown.</p><p>\"This is because councillors are elected by the electors, they are not appointed by the executive government, and payments made to them are determined by statutory entitlements in respect of their offices,\" Dr Laing wrote.</p><p>However, Dr Laing advised Ms Lambie: \"It is for you to decide whether he will be ultra-cautious and resign his office of mayor before nominating.\"</p><p>The Australian Electoral Commission advises on its website: \"Such positions as councillors and employees of local government, and members of the governing bodies and the employees of statutory authorities, could be at risk of disqualification, depending on their particular circumstances.\"</p><p>It's been argued local councillors should be treated no differently to sitting state MPs, who can't be candidates for federal parliament.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Liberal candidate expected to replace Hollie Hughes says he will have no problem meeting either the citizenship or \"office of profit\" provisions.</p><p>Retired major general Jim Molan has in the past been a contractor to the Defence Department, but told AAP on Friday he performed no consulting work in the disqualifying period.</p><p>Mr Molan was born in Australia as were his parents and four grandparents.</p><p>The Greens are still seeking advice as to whether newly sworn senator Andrew Bartlett could be disqualified over the university job he held at the time of the 2016 election.</p><p>And Liberal MP John Alexander, who quit over his dual citizenship, has received confirmation of his renunciation from the British Home Office and will be able to defend his seat of Bennelong in the December 16 by-election.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37904606/court-sets-date-for-parry-lambie-case/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37904606/court-sets-date-for-parry-lambie-case/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37904606/court-sets-date-for-parry-lambie-case/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37904606/court-sets-date-for-parry-lambie-case/"},"by_line":"Paul

prepares to launch his latest campaign at Rosehill.</p><p>While the Magic Millions carnival in January is a target, his Warwick Farm trainer has no concerns about Testashadow being ready to make an impression in Saturday's November Handicap (1400m).</p><p>The six-year-old had his first start at Canterbury in February 2014 and 34 races later a $50,000 yearling at the 2013 Magic Millions sale has earned more than $1.2 million.</p><p>\"To win $1.2 million, that's just crazy. You'd never have thought that,\" Portelli said.</p><p>Testashadow was sent to Portelli after being picked out by Elite Thoroughrbeds' Adrian Allan who then assembled an ownership group that has frequently had their expectations tempered.</p><p>\"When we've got to the end of each preparation I've sort of warned the owners this might be as far as he's going to go,\" Portelli said.</p><p>However, Testashadow has repeatedly defied those predictions.</p><p>\"He's been a fantastic little horse for setting the bar high for himself,\" Portelli said.</p><p>\"He just keeps proving me wrong, in the right way.\"</p><p>Testashadow opened his previous preparation with the most lucrative win of his career in the $1 million Magic Millions Cup on the Gold Coast in January.</p><p>He also picked up third placings in the Liverpool City Cup, Group Two Ajax Stakes and Hawkesbury Gold Cup.</p><p>Portelli said defending the Magic Millions Cup (1400m) appealed but Testashadow might instead target the Group Two Villiers Stakes (1600m) at Randwick in a month.</p><p>Testashadow was rated an $8 chance with the TAB on Friday with the Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott-trained Cabeza de Vaca heading the market at $2.60.</p><p>\"We're pretty happy with him. His form says he goes well fresh,\" Portelli said.</p><p>Portelli added he was satisfied Seabring Express ($10) could improve significantly on her last-start eighth when she runs in a Benchmark 74 Handicap (1200m).</p><p>\"I like her ridden off the pace but at Randwick she was up on the speed against instructions and we saw a very ordinary run from her,\" Portelli said.</p><p>\"She'll be ridden back this time. She's a very good filly. I don't think we've seen the best of her.\"</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/racing/a/37907779/testashadow-to-the-fore-at-rosehill/","au.ausport":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/racing/a/37907779/testashadow-to-the-fore-at-rosehill/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907779/testashadow-to-the-fore-at-rosehill/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/sport/37907779/testashadow-to-the-fore-at-rosehill/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/sport/a/-/sport/37907779/testashadow-to-the-fore-at-rosehill/"},"by_line":"Chris

(AFP) - UN negotiations on implementing the Paris climate change agreement wrap up Friday after two weeks of talks that were slowed down by the United States defending the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Envoys from nearly 200 countries, including delegates from Washington, gathered for the conference in Bonn to negotiate a \"rulebook\", to be adopted next year, for enacting the global deal reached to cheers and champagne in 2015.</p><p>Delegates reported mixed progress in Germany, with the reemergence of divisions between rich and developing countries.</p><p>A key stumbling block was on finance for the world's poorer nations to help them prepare for, and deal with, the fallout from climate change -- including more frequent and severe superstorms, droughts and land- and crop-gobbling sea level rises.</p><p>Another obstacle was the insistence of developed nations -- led by the US -- that all countries share similar obligations under the Paris pact, while developing greenhouse gas polluters want a certain degree of leeway.</p><p>The November 6-17 conference is the first of the UN's climate body since President Donald Trump announced in June that the US will withdraw from the agreement championed by his predecessor Barack Obama.</p><p>The rules determine it can only leave in November 2020, and in the meantime, Washington continues to fill its seat at the climate talks.</p><p>\"The stars are not well aligned since Trump's exit\" from the pact, Seyni Nafo, a negotiator for African nations, told AFP of the talks.</p><p>\"It's like the heart wasn't there. The position of the United States influences other developed countries, which in turn has consequences for the positions major developing nations adopt. It's a game of wait-and-see.\"</p><p>Not helping the mood, White House officials hosted a sideline event with energy company bosses Monday to defend the continued use of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas blamed for emitting planet-warming gases into the Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>At its very essence, the Paris Agreement seeks a drawdown of carbon emissions.</p><p>The pact commits countries to limiting average global warming to under two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over Industrial Revolution levels, and 1.5 C if possible, to avert worst-case-scenario climate change.</p><p>- 'Ridiculous' -</p><p>Nations submitted voluntary emissions-cutting commitments to bolster the deal, but scientists say the pledges place the world on course for warming of 3 C or more.</p><p>How, and when, to update country commitments to bring them in line with the 2 C target, is a central topic in the ongoing negotiations.</p><p>\"Our task has been made all the more difficult with the disengagement of the world?s largest historic emitter from the Paris Agreement,\" Maldives environment minister Thoriq Ibrahim told delegates Thursday on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States at the forefront of climate change-driven sea-level rises.</p><p>The Trump administration insisted, however, that it was \"committed\" to limiting greenhouse gas emissions -- as long as this does not threaten energy security or the economy.</p><p>Acting assistant secretary of state Judith Garber told the conference that the US would \"support the cleanest, most efficient power generation, regardless of the source\".</p><p>An Obama-era official who helped deliver the Paris agreement -- a feat that took more than two decades of tough negotiations -- lashed out at Trump's \"wrongheaded\" decision to withdraw from the pact.</p><p>\"Climate change is a huge challenge, we all know that,\" Todd Stern, who was Obama's special envoy for climate change, told AFP on the sidelines of the conference he attended as an observer. He left government in 2016.</p><p>\"Trying to say it's a hoax, or it doesn't mean anything, or it's a terrible agreement and the rest of the world is laughing at us, is just so... ridiculous,\" he said -- citing some of Trump's stated reasons.</p><p>The United States is the world's biggest historical greenhouse gas polluter, and second only to China for current-day emissions.</p><p>The negotiations will carry on without the US, and nations and businesses will continue moving away from fossil fuels, said Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid, which represents poor country interests at the talks.</p><p>He pointed to a coal phase-out initiative launched in Bonn Thursday with the backing of 20 countries -- led by Britain and Canada.</p><p>\"But what we have lost is the diplomatic leadership of the US in driving the process,\" added Adow.</p><p>\"We are missing the old US administration in lining up the politics.\"</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/37907739/un-climate-talks-wrap-up-as-us-stands-firm-on-fossil-fuels/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/37907739/un-climate-talks-wrap-up-as-us-stands-firm-on-fossil-fuels/"},"by_line":"by

Australia shifted from Coffs Harbour, but the defending champion certainly doesn't share that opinion after finishing day one of his title defence with a big lead.</p><p>The northern NSW coastal town is hosting a World Rally Championship leg for the sixth time and will do so again in 2018.</p><p>But its place on the calendar is not guaranteed beyond that, despite a three-year funding commitment from the NSW government and a significant crowd increase this year.</p><p>Hyundai driver Thierry Neuville and his experienced manager Alain Penasse both agree Coffs Harbour is too remote and low-key to host a leg of the tour that includes Monte Carlo, Argentina and rally-mad Finland.</p><p>But Norway's Mikkelsen, who holds a 20.9 second lead over England's Kris Meeke with two days of racing remaining, says the region's jungle-like forestry roads deserve their place on the world stage.</p><p>\"Yes, definitely; it's a different rally to the others and it's called the World Rally Championship, we should be visiting the world,\" he told AAP.</p><p>\"Rally Australia is all about the nature, it's fast and flowing - like driving in the jungle - and that's why it's different to the

France and South Africa in their international Test match on Saturday, Springboks coach Allister Coetzee believes.</p><p>Both sides are in poor form and have endured a torrid time since the 2015 Rugby World Cup.</p><p>South Africa suffered their worst ever season in 2016, losing eight of 12 full international matches while 2017 has seen then suffer an all-time record defeat -- 57-0 at the hands of New Zealand in September -- before last week going down to their heaviest loss to Ireland, 38-3.</p><p>Added to that, they discovered on Wednesday they had missed out on the right to host the 2023 World Cup to France.</p><p>But Coetzee says it is the desire to improve on their 50 percent win percentage this year rather than notions of bid revenge which is motivating them ahead of Saturday's clash at the Stade de France.</p><p>\"Obviously losing the bid, it's not ideal for a country like South Africa,\" said the 54-year-old coach.</p><p>\"We would have loved to be having that opportunity, it would've been massive for our country.</p><p>\"We accept the result, but for us as a team we focus on the Test this week. It won't motivate us necessarily differently.</p><p>\"We've got a plan and we'd like to go and execute our plan and perform; that's our job, we need to play well.</p><p>\"We've got what I would say is a very improved French team that will come out.</p><p>\"In a way both teams are desperate this weekend to get a result and that's what we're facing.\"</p><p>The Springboks won their first five matches this year, including a comfortable 3-0 whitewash of the touring French in June, but have not won in five more since.</p><p>Guy Noves can hardly boast a better record than Coetzee since taking over the France reins following their humiliating 62-13 World Cup quarter-final mauling by New Zealand in 2015.</p><p>Seven wins have been offset by 12 defeats but Coetzee has been impressed with the new breed of young stars blooded by Noves, including half-back pair Antoine Dupont and Anthony Belleau.</p><p>- 'Sniping scrum-half' -</p><p>\"When you look at the French team and see the changes compared to the team that played in South Africa (in June), they have got an exciting half-back combination and then you have (Mathieu) Bastareaud who is the big centre to generate gain line and momentum.</p><p>\"The French style of play is an exciting one and the sniping scrum-half (Dupont) really played well against the All Blacks and at 10 (Belleau) is also really an elusive runner.</p><p>\"That's the reason why they add spice to their game.\"</p><p>While Coetzee has made four changes to the side which capitulated in the final 10 minutes against Ireland, conceding three converted tries, Noves has picked the same starting XV that lost 38-18 to New Zealand.</p><p>But he warned his players they are under pressure from those who featured in the French XV that lost only 28-23 to a second string New Zealand in Lyon on Tuesday.</p><p>\"I don't know if they should be looking for revenge or simply to show the side they did a bit more intelligently in the second half,\" said Noves about that All Blacks defeat, in which his side 'won' the second period 13-7 having been blown off the park in a scintillating first 40 minutes by the tourists.</p><p>\"I expect them to lift themselves and come off the pitch, as their pals did (on Tuesday), with their heads held high.\"</p><p>Noves made only one change to his bench with uncapped prop Sebastien Taofifenua replacing Raphael Chaume, who was injured on his debut against New Zealand.</p><p>Coetzee has picked Handre Pollard and Francois Venter in the 10-12 channel in place of Elton Jantjies and Damian de Allende, with Duane Vermeulen and Wilco Louw replacing injured duo Coenie Oosthuizen and Pieter-Steph du Toit in the pack.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/rugby/a/37907691/coetzee-sees-despair-date-for-france-south-africa-test-match/","au.ausport":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/rugby/a/37907691/coetzee-sees-despair-date-for-france-south-africa-test-match/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907691/coetzee-sees-despair-date-for-france-south-africa-test-match/"},"by_line":"by

to save icons from polluted ruin","body":"<p>Ahmedabad (India) (AFP) - Traffic chokes the centuries-old stone archway into Ahmedabad's historic quarter, the snarl of honking rickshaws and sputtering buses coats the monuments of India's only heritage city in a greasy layer of soot.</p><p>Conservation experts warn Ahmedabad, one of the world's most polluted cities, faces a mammoth task defending its newly won UNESCO status as its fragile cultural icons decay under neglect, traffic and trash.</p><p>The 600-year-old enclave was named India's first 'World Heritage City' in July -- despite warnings from some of UNESCO's own experts that it lacked a convincing plan for protecting its ancient citadels, mosques and tombs.</p><p>Ahmedabad hosts the towering Bhadra fort, the legendary stone latticework of the 16th-century Sidi Saiyyed mosque, and countless relics fusing the unique Hindu and Muslim architectural styles of its conquerors.</p><p>Authorities hope the global recognition from the UN's cultural body will restore community pride in the crumbling, garbage-strewn old city.</p><p>\"They themselves also will be slightly more restrained in dirtying the places,\" said P.K Ghosh, chairman of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation?s heritage conservation committee, of the city's inhabitants.</p><p>But many families that once fastidiously tended to ornate wooden homes in the old city are leaving in droves for the comforts of the modern city outside, tired of shabby living conditions.</p><p>- Treasures in ruin -</p><p>Jagruti Vyas, a long-term resident, hoped the UNESCO listing would bring standards in her dilapidated neighbourhood into line with newer areas beyond the old city's walls.</p><p>\"We hope to see similar changes, such as this part of the city becoming cleaner,\" she told AFP from the narrow doorway of her wooden home.</p><p>But it is the pressures of modern Ahmedabad -- the chronic air pollution, crushing traffic and chaotic urban sprawl -- that experts say are also rapidly eroding its cultural capital.</p><p>The cramped heritage district was never built for cars, yet today thousands of trucks and rickshaws are diverted through its narrow lanes and alleys.</p><p>The grinding congestion tears apart roads and fouls the air with fumes, streaking stone-carved monuments with black exhaust stains.</p><p>Long-flouted laws banning construction near heritage sites have also hampered efforts to save Ahmedabad's treasures from ruin.</p><p>In the heart of the old quarter, just the dome of a medieval mosque is visible behind a tangle of shops, electricity wires and flats illegally erected around the sultanate-era relic.</p><p>Ornate homes have been torn down and replaced by garish structures \"totally incongruous\" with history, said Ghosh.</p><p>He said the heritage listing would give teeth to those safeguarding Ahmedabad's architectural heritage.</p><p>\"There will be stricter enforcement of the rules. \"Pulling down the exquisite old architectural pieces will not be easy now,\" he told AFP.</p><p>- Challenge starts now -</p><p>Some long-neglected quarters, sealed off from the outside world by labyrinthine alleys, are well beyond restoration.</p><p>Many traditional 'pols' -- clusters of settlements identified by UNESCO as bearing \"enormous\" historical value -- are all but abandoned, the iconic wooden homes collapsing from neglect.</p><p>A small boy was injured in October when a balcony caved in, while at least two people died in July when monsoon rains brought whole houses crashing down, media reported.</p><p>Once grand havelis -- beautiful multi-level wooden mansions -- are being rented to poor migrants and businesses looking for warehouse space.</p><p>Conservation architect and old city expert Khushi Shah said Ahmedabad was \"one of the most unique urban settlements in India\" that could not be recreated once it was gone.</p><p>\"The city which we call a 'living heritage entity' will no longer be so if people start moving out,\" she told AFP.</p><p>Ahmedabad's conservation committee has three years to document close to 3,000 buildings of heritage value to strict UNESCO standards -- a monumental task for Ghosh's small team.</p><p>UNESCO could revoke or downgrade Ahmedabad's listing to \"heritage in danger\" should the deadline be missed and the committee fail to show it has slowed the decline and destruction of the old city.</p><p>Jigna Desai, associate professor at CEPT University's architecture faculty in Ahmedabad, said the coveted UNESCO inscription would mean little

in true Yorkshire style, are remarkably down to earth.</p>","title":"Craft beers and celestial bars in Leeds","body":"<p>\"All t'fatties out!\" shouts a joker in the crammed hotel lift. We're headed for the hotel's rooftop terrace bar on level 13, which has been enthusiastically adopted by the locals. But we're over the weight limit and the lift is refusing to budge.</p><p>Leeds is the UK's fastest-growing city, driven by financial services and the business sector. And with economic renewal has come cultural vitality - the Lonely Planet Guide named Leeds as one of the 10 best visitor destinations in Europe for 2017.</p><p>Boasting a world-class museum (the Royal Armouries), internationally renowned opera and ballet companies, restaurants at the cutting edge of foodie culture and a clutch of sophisticated shopping arcades, the northern city's transformation is breathtaking.</p><p>Dour decades of industrial grime have been scraped away, and what's left is a confident, entrepreneurial metropolis which, just as in its Victorian heyday, embraces the glitz and glamour of prosperity.</p><p>But down-to-earth Leeds folk haven't changed at all. So whatever your budget, the city adds up to an exceptional - and at times hilarious - travel experience.</p><p>WHERE TO STAY</p><p>Stepping into the DoubleTree by Hilton is a dramatic, almost Harry Potterish experience: Descend from the bridge above Platform 17 at Leeds Railway Station into the Dark Arches (brick tunnels built in Victorian times to carry the tumbling waters of the River Aire), then emerge into a blaze of daylight by the Leeds And Liverpool Canal. The heated terrace by the towpath offers soothing views of narrowboats chugging gently along the waterway.</p><p>A budget option is Art Hostel (arthostel.org.uk) in Kirkgate. Managed by East Street Arts as a social enterprise, each room has been individually designed using recycled materials. There are cooking facilities on site and you can pick up fresh ingredients at Kirkgate Market, just moments away. Drop by to say hello and pick up the very useful Art Hostel Free Guide to Leeds' independent scene.</p><p>WHAT TO DO</p><p>The Royal Armouries (royalarmouries.org) is the national collection of arms and armour, much of it previously stored in the Tower Of London, and essentially a shrine to the ways people can kill each other. Horrible? Yes. But the collection is also about innovation, technology and superb craftmanship.</p><p>You can ponder the sad role of conflict in the world - or you can ogle the size of Henry VIII's codpiece. It's enormous. And there's a war elephant. Pick up the free water taxi near the DoubleTree by Hilton and enjoy a 20-minute cruise along the River Aire to the steps of the waterside museum. Entrance is free.</p><p>Recently reopened following refurbishment, Leeds Art Gallery (leeds.gov.uk/artgallery) on The Headrow is overshadowed, architecturally, by Cuthbert Brodrick's splendid 1850s Leeds Town Hall next door. The Gallery's treasures lie within - built in 1886-8 by public subscription, the stunning Victorian glazed roof was rediscovered by builders after it was boxed in during the 1970s.</p><p>Explore the work of British watercolourist John Sell Cotman, or catch a major retrospective of the sculptures and drawings of Joseph Beuys (both exhibitions are on until January 21). The Tiled Hall Cafe, with magnificent marble columns and a mosaic ceiling, is a work of art in itself. Entrance is free.</p><p>WHERE TO SHOP</p><p>The Grand Arcade is, ironically, the least grand of Leeds' many covered shopping streets. These range from Thornton's Arcade (opened in 1878 and home today to quirky independent retailers, such as OK Comics) to the much newer Victoria Gate.</p><p>The jewel in the crown is The Victoria Quarter, designed in 1900 by Frank Matcham, better known for his theatres. A branch of Harvey Nichols now stands on the site of the original Empire Theatre. The remainder of the covered complex is filled with high-end stores from Space NK to Vivienne Westwood, and the Tesla car company has just opened a showroom. To describe it as one of the most beautiful shopping malls in Britain is no exaggeration.</p><p>WHERE TO EAT</p><p>You won't go hungry in a city that understands the importance of \"a bit of a do\". Issho (issho-restaurant.com), a rooftop restaurant in Victoria Gate, offers contemporary Japanese cuisine - small sharing plates of skewered meats (robatayaki) and upmarket sushi.</p><p>Friends of Ham (friendsofham.co.uk), near the railway station, is a classy option that needn't bust the budget. Don't be fooled by the decor - the rustic simplicity of the bar, with its rough-hewn communal tables, suggests a taverna in a Spanish village. But the tapas is to die for, as are both the fortified wine and craft beer lists.</p><p>Canny daytime shoppers should opt for a substantial Chorizo Monsieur (a Spanish version of the classic French toasted sandwich) from the brunch menu, which will set you up for the rest of the day.</p><p>A second branch in the Grand Arcade does pre-theatre suppers: Small plates of top-notch charcuterie and fabulous cheeseboards are a speciality, as well as three-course meals. Look out for special deals in conjunction with shows. They're popular, so book in advance.</p><p>Kirkgate Market is Europe's largest indoor market and the place where in 1894 the Polish Jewish refugee Mr Marks joined forces with English bookkeeper Mr Spencer to open a permanent stall. The market is the place to stock up on picnic items such as award-winning pork pies - and the building has Grade One listed status. The Fisherman's Wife (thefishermanswife.co.uk) chippy, between the market and John Lewis, offers classic British street food (haddock and chips) and there's a sit-down option too.</p><p>WHERE TO DRINK</p><p>Leeds is famous for its array of craft beers, and one of the best places to sample what's on offer is Whitelocks, a small complex of ale houses down an alleyway off Briggate. Dating from 1715, it was described by poet John Betjeman as \"the very heart of Leeds\".</p><p>Try the Turk's Head (turksheadleeds.co.uk), a modern bar with 14 British draught beers, or The Cross Keys (the-crosskeys.com) gastropub on Water Lane.</p><p>Curiously for a city up north, open-air rooftop bars have been a hit in Leeds. Uplifting views across the city to the Pennines might have something to do with it, as well as Northern drinkers' famous indifference to the weather.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907670/craft-beers-and-celestial-bars-in-leeds/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907670/craft-beers-and-celestial-bars-in-leeds/","au.auprime7":"https://au.prime7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37907670/craft-beers-and-celestial-bars-in-leeds/","au.augwn7":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com/region/news/a/-/local/37907670/craft-beers-and-celestial-bars-in-leeds/"},"by_line":"Liz

$7.</p>","title":"$7.5 million Schumacher Ferrari sets record: Sotheby's","body":"<p>New York (AFP) - Michael Schumacher's Grand Prix-Winning Ferrari sold for $7.5 million in New York on Thursday, setting an auction record for a modern-era Formula One car, Sotheby's said.</p><p>The seven-time world champion's 2001 Ferrari F2001 sparked furious bidding, roaring past its pre-sale estimate of $4-5 million at Sotheby's flagship post-war and contemporary November evening art sale.</p><p>It put the buzz into a night that otherwise fell short of the dizzying heights reached by Christie's on Wednesday selling a painting of Christ attributed to Leonardo da Vinci for a record $450.3 million.</p><p>Sotheby's said it was the first time that a rare automobile was included in an art auction and the decision appeared popular.</p><p>The sleek, low-slung, fire-engine red vehicle may not have been a work of art, but Gregoire Billault, senior Sotheby's vice president, called it \"the very best racing car ever sold at an auction.\"</p><p>The German racing legend has not been seen in public since suffering serious head injuries in a skiing accident in 2013. His record of seven titles and 91 career victories remains unchallenged.</p><p>When it came to the art, Sotheby's headline lot, a Francis Bacon triptych of the artist's lover sold for $38.6 million, well within its estimate of $35-45 million.</p><p>The auction record for a Bacon triptych is his \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\" which sold for $142.4 million at Christie's in 2013.</p><p>Sotheby's other standout Thursday was an iconic 1972 Andy Warhol portrait of the founder of Communist China, Mao Zedong, which sold for $32.4 million, the auction house said.</p><p>Exhibited in Berlin, Turin and Paris, the painting had not previously been on public display since 1974.</p><p>The other 10 \"Mao\" paintings of the same size are in prestigious collections, including the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37906463/7-5-million-schumacher-ferrari-sets-record-sothebys/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37906463/7-5-million-schumacher-ferrari-sets-record-sothebys/"},"by_line":null,"profile_id":null,"seo_headline":"$7.5

He is accused of plotting to take power with American help.<br/>              Hun Sen's critics called the CNRP dissolution an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy after Western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multiparty system following decades of war.<br/>              \"On current course next year&rsquo;s election will not be legitimate, free, or fair,\" a White House statement said, promising to take \"concrete steps\".<br/>              The first of those was to end support for the Cambodian National Election Committee ahead of the 2018 election, it said.<br/>              In Brussels, an EU spokesman said the election could not be legitimate without the opposition and noted that respect for human rights was a prerequisite for Cambodia's access to EU trade preferences under its \"Everything But Arms scheme.\"<br/>              That scheme giving tariff free access - and similar trade preferences in the United States - have helped Cambodia build a garment industry on low cost labor. Between them, EU and U.S. markets take some 60 percent of Cambodia's exports.<br/>              There was no immediate government response to the reaction from the United States and European Union.<br/>              In a symbolic step, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution calling on the Treasury and State Departments to consider placing Cambodian officials implicated in abuses on a watch list for asset freezes and travel bans.<br/>              <br/>              WAR OF WORDS<br/>              Hun Sen has been in a deepening war of words with the U.S. embassy and State Department over a crackdown on his critics, but at the weekend posed with U.S. President Donald Trump at a regional summit and praised his policies of non-interference.<br/>              The fact that the threat of action came from the White House gave it greater weight than previous statements from the State Department calling for the release of Kem Sokha.<br/>              So far Western countries have shown little appetite for sanctions and the opposition itself has shied away from calling for steps to restrict garment exports because of the hundreds of thousands of workers who depend on them.<br/>              But leaders of the CNRP now say they support some sanctions.<br/>              \"Sanctions are the best leverage for negotiation for free, fair and inclusive elections,\" said Mu Sochua, a deputy to CNRP leader Kem Sokha who fled Cambodia fearing arrest.<br/>              There have been no protests over the ruling and many people in the capital, Phnom Penh, said they were afraid to speak out.<br/>              There were no party members at the CNRP headquarters, only security guards. \"They are worried about their safety,\" said security guard Chin Savy.<br/>              The central market was full of its usual bustle and one man told Reuters he was glad to see the back of the opposition.<br/>              \"Hun Sen has a lot of help from China. If he just depended on the U.S. we wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere,\" said Khen Kong, 69, a businessman.<br/>              China is by far the biggest single donor to Cambodia and its biggest investor. It voiced support for the government after the arrest of Kem Sokha.<br/>              In a televised address on Thursday, Hun Sen told Cambodians the election would go ahead \"as normal\" and appealed to politicians from the CNRP who had not been banned to join his Cambodian People's Party (CPP).<br/>              U.S.-based campaign group Human Rights Watch said the court ruling should lead Cambodia's donors and trade partners to impose targeted sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans on Hun Sen's inner circle.<br/>              <br/>               (Writing by Matthew

Mexico","body":"<p>Los Angeles (AFP) - After conquering Mile High Stadium, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots are focused on scaling a new summit as the Super Bowl champions make their debut in the thin air of Mexico City on Sunday.</p><p>For the second season in a row, the National Football League is rolling south of the border with a regular season game in Mexico, with the Patriots taking on the Oakland Raiders at the iconic Azteca Stadium.</p><p>While the Raiders played in last season's game at the venue, defeating the Houston Texans, Sunday's fixture represents a first foray to Mexico for the Patriots, who routed Denver in a 41-16 road win on Sunday.</p><p>Bill Belichick's men remained in Colorado this week to prepare for another challenging game at altitude. The Azteca is 7,280 feet above sea level, a full 2,000 feet higher than the Broncos home venue.</p><p>The Patriots have spent the week training at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs to help acclimatise to altitude before heading to Mexico City on the eve of Sunday's game.</p><p>Brady said spending the week in a virtual mid-season training camp could give the Patriots an edge as they aim to improve to 8-2 to tighten their grip at the top of the AFC East divisional standings.</p><p>\"I think it's a good opportunity for us to really just be out here together, no distractions except getting ready to play a game and that could be a real benefit for all of us if we take care of it,\" Brady said.</p><p>- 'He's the best' -</p><p>The Raiders meanwhile must find a way to contain a Patriots offense that is looking increasingly formidable just as their defense is starting to gel.</p><p>The Patriots' victory over the Broncos on Sunday was the fifth straight game where they restricted their opponents to 17 points or fewer.</p><p>Brady meanwhile threw for three touchdowns and no interceptions against Denver, helping him win his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week award.</p><p>The 40-year-old five-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback now leads the NFL passing stats this season, with 2,807 yards, an average of 311 yards per game.</p><p>\"He's the best,\" Raiders safety Reggie Nelson said when asked about the challenge of stifling Brady. \"He's the best at what he does. Who's trying to argue that?\"</p><p>While the Patriots once again appear to be  the team to beat in the AFC, the NFC has been harder to call, with tight races in three of the four divisions led by teams with 7-2 records.</p><p>The Philadelphia Eagles (8-1) meanwhile will aim to all but extinguish the challenge of the Dallas Cowboys (5-4) in the NFC East when the two arch-rivals collide in Texas on Sunday.</p><p>- Goff v Keenum -</p><p>With the Eagles disappearing over the horizon in the divisional standings, the Cowboys must somehow conjure a victory in Arlington to remain in the hunt for a wildcard berth.</p><p>Dallas however head into the game after being pummelled by the Falcons in Atlanta last week, and will once again be without suspended running back Ezekiel Elliott.</p><p>Elsewhere in the NFC, former team-mates Jared Goff and Case Keenum will go head-to-head as the in-form Los Angeles Rams (7-2) travel to Minneapolis to take on the Minnesota Vikings (7-2).</p><p>Rams quarterback Goff was Keenum's understudy at the Rams in his rookie season last year before supplanting Keenum as starter mid-way through the season.</p><p>Keenum, 29, was signed as a back-up by the Vikings but has flourished since replacing injured starter Sam Bradford in week two.</p><p>Goff, the 2016 No.1 overall draft pick, is looking forward to squaring off against his former mentor Keenum.</p><p>\"I shot him a text the other day and we're both excited for it,\" Goff said.</p><p>\"He's been doing so well this year and as a guy, there's not a guy you could be more happy for.\"</p><p>Keenum was equally complimentary about Goff, who passed for a career-high 355 yards in Sunday's demolition of the Houston Texans. Goff leads the NFL this season with an average of 8.5 yards per pass attempt.</p><p>\"He's a smart kid, man,\" Keenum said of Goff. \"He's a fighter, too, because it wasn't easy last year.</p><p>\"He got the crap knocked out of him a few times and got back up and can sling it. Obviously, everybody is seeing what he can do this year, but we've known for a long time he's a really good player.\"</p>","urls":{"au":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907504/brady-patriots-ready-to-hit-heights-in-mexico/","au.aunews-mp":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/37907504/brady-patriots-ready-to-hit-heights-in-mexico/"},"by_line":"by

Japanese, Chinese and western influences mingle in such perfect harmony.</p>","title":"Taipei an enticing mix of influences","body":"<p>\"When she poured the tea and added hot water it danced inside the pot,\" brew master Ronnie Lin says.</p><p>\"She\" is the Queen of England and, according to the story, when her majesty brewed the tea the leaves shimmered as if they were dancing. She named them Oriental Beauty.</p><p>The highly prized blend of oolong tea comes from northern Taiwan and was given to the Queen by a merchant, or so the legend goes.</p><p>Lin is presiding over a tea tasting ceremony in the capital Taipei and the ceremony has a distinct set of steps, including how long the water is boiled for, how long the tea must sit and, most importantly, how the tea is drunk.</p><p>The master says great importance should also be placed on how the tea smells.</p><p>\"If the tea suits, you will feel very relaxed and good, then it is a tea for you.\"</p><p>Lin believes young Taiwanese need to embrace the traditions as a remedy to their busy lives.</p><p>The residents of Taipei could certainly use some calm. It is one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, and home to 2.7 million people. Their lives are busy and fast-paced.</p><p>My hotel the Grand Hyatt Taipei offers me the perfect sanctuary, as well as an incredible view of the city's tall skyscrapers, including one of the largest in Asia, the Taipei 101.</p><p>Wandering the streets, I also notice many western franchises and I learn that the city has more 7-Eleven convenience stores per square metre than just about anywhere else in the world.</p><p>But it's not the city's growing western influences that make it so interesting.</p><p>Taiwan has a complicated history that you can't escape - even by drinking tea.</p><p>Our ceremony is being held in a Japanese-style house with sliding doors, plenty of wood and a tiled roof in Taipei's Zhongzheng District.</p><p>The Japanese left in 1945 but the city has been unable to cover over their footprints. They remain in the architecture, the city's many Japanese supermarkets and restaurants, and the country's love of baseball.</p><p>The city is also dominated by the influences of China, who deems the island a renegade province.</p><p>Over two million mainland Chinese nationalists fled to the island after the communist gained power in 1949.</p><p>Being dominated by other cultures means Taiwan is often overlooked on the tourist map, with travellers more likely to visit the Great Wall or Tokyo's cherry blossoms.</p><p>This is a shame. Existing as a cultural melting pot of Chinese, Japanese and Western influences makes Taipei an enticing place for tourists.</p><p>Craving authentic Japanese food? Taiwan has a live seafood market of nearly 2,000 squaremeters, similar to Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market, with small sushi and wine bars among live fish sellers.</p><p>Like Chinese art? Taipei's National Palace Museum houses nearly 700,000 pieces of ancient Chinese artefacts and artworks spanning 2000 years from the Forbidden City, which the nationalists brought with them when they fled the mainland.</p><p>Among the rarest is a piece of jade crafted to look like a piece of bok choy cabbage, carved during the Qing dynasty.</p><p>Taipei also has enough western influences to make the city easy to navigate for English speakers. With the language compulsory for schoolchildren, most people under 40 have a grasp of the language.</p><p>Unlike mainland China, there are less issues with pollution and smog - nor is there a need for a holiday visa for Australians to visit Taiwan.</p><p>Street food vendors have menus in Mandarin, Japanese and English and the up-market shopping malls are packed with all kinds of western brands imaginable. They're all connected by a metro system considered among the best in the world.</p><p>This makes Taipei fast and easy to navigate, enabling you to sample its rich history and culture.</p><p>IF YOU GO</p><p>GETTING THERE: Taipei sits on the northern tip of Taiwan and its airport is about 30km from the city centre. AirAsia flies to Taipei from Sydney via Kuala Lumpur.</p><p>STAYING THERE: The Grand Hyatt Taipei offers rooms with a stunning view of Taipei 101, one of the largest skyscrapers in Asia, and is strategically located in the heart of the city. Prices start at around $A280 per night.</p><p>PLAYING THERE: Yoshan Tea offers a one-hour tea tasting experience, during which you get to roast your own tea and take some home.
